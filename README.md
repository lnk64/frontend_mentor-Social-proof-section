## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

To start incorperating LESS preprocessor into my work flow.

I'd also like to work with an system on just adjusting the font-size at the root level based on viewport, and then just use EM's along with clamp() and vw, further within the containers to control padding and font sizes, in order to get better and making projects scale better as viewports change, so that there is less "snapping" as breakpoints are met.

Lastly, I want to work on more efficient SVG uses. Im not 100% happy with my solution on using the stars, and was hoping for a function to define the svg once and repeat it 5x, instead of me just declaring it 5x at the html level.
