## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![mobile view](/images/screenshot-mobile.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

To start incorperating LESS preprocessor into my work flow.

I'd also like to work with an system on just adjusting the font-size at the root level based on viewport, and then just use EM's along with clamp() and vw, further within the containers to control padding and font sizes, in order to get better and making projects scale better as viewports change, so that there is less "snapping" as breakpoints are met.

Lastly, I want to work on more efficient SVG uses. Im not 100% happy with my solution on using the stars, and was hoping for a function to define the svg once and repeat it 5x, instead of me just declaring it 5x at the html level.
